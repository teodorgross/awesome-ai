# Getting Started with Artificial Intelligence

Welcome to the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence! This comprehensive guide will take you from complete beginner to having a solid understanding of AI fundamentals.

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

### Key Characteristics of AI

- **Learning**: The ability to improve performance on tasks through experience
- **Reasoning**: The ability to solve problems through logical deduction
- **Perception**: The ability to interpret sensory data
- **Language Processing**: The ability to understand and generate human language
- **Decision Making**: The ability to make choices based on available information

## Types of Artificial Intelligence

### 1. Narrow AI (Weak AI)

Narrow AI is designed to perform a narrow task extremely well. Examples include:

- **Voice Assistants**: Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant
- **Image Recognition**: Face detection in photos
- **Recommendation Systems**: Netflix, Spotify, Amazon
- **Game Playing**: Chess programs, Go programs

```python
# Example: Simple AI decision making
def ai_recommendation(user_history, available_items):
    """
    Simple recommendation algorithm based on user history
    """
    recommendations = []
    for item in available_items:
        if is_similar_to_history(item, user_history):
            recommendations.append(item)
    return sort_by_relevance(recommendations)
```

### 2. General AI (Strong AI)

General AI would have the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level equal to human intelligence. This doesn't exist yet but is the ultimate goal of AI research.

### 3. Superintelligence

A hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence in all aspects. This is still theoretical and subject of much debate.

## Core AI Technologies

### Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

#### Types of Machine Learning:

1. **Supervised Learning**
   - Uses labeled training data
   - Examples: Classification, Regression
   - Tools: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow

2. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - Finds patterns in data without labels
   - Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
   - Tools: K-means, PCA

3. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - Learns through interaction with environment
   - Examples: Game playing, Robotics
   - Tools: OpenAI Gym, Stable Baselines

### Deep Learning

Deep Learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns.

```python
# Example: Simple neural network structure
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```
