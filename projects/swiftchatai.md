- **Backend**: Python FastAPI with AWS Lambda/App Runner deployment
- **AI Models**: Amazon Bedrock (Nova, Titan) with fallback to other providers
- **Infrastructure**: CloudFormation templates for easy AWS deployment
- **Storage**: AWS Parameter Store for configuration management

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: AWS account with Bedrock model access, React Native development environment
2. **Clone Repository**: Download from GitHub and navigate to react-native folder
3. **Install Dependencies**: Run npm install and platform-specific setup (pod install for iOS)
4. **Configure AWS**: Set up Parameter Store with API keys and deploy CloudFormation stack
5. **Launch**: Execute npm start and build for your target platform

## Deployment Options

- **AWS App Runner**: Fully managed container service for production
- **AWS Lambda**: Cost-effective serverless option with Function URLs
- **Local Development**: Run backend locally for testing and development

SwiftChat represents a comprehensive solution for developers looking to build sophisticated Chat applications with enterprise-grade AWS infrastructure while maintaining the flexibility of open-source development.
