# Open WebUI

**Open WebUI** is a powerful, self-hosted AI chat interface designed for full offline use. It supports multiple LLM backends like **Ollama**, **OpenAI-compatible APIs**, and includes a built-in inference engine for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Its modular design and plugin system make it ideal for custom deployments in enterprise and developer environments.

## Key Features

- 🚀 **Easy Installation**: Use Docker, Kubernetes, or `pip` for quick setup.
- 🤖 **Ollama & OpenAI API Support**: Chat with models locally or via API (Groq, Mistral, OpenRouter, etc.).
- 🔐 **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Create user groups and permissions for secure collaboration.
- 📚 **Built-in RAG Support**: Load and query documents within the chat using the `#` command.
- 🎨 **Integrated Image Generation**: Use DALL·E, ComfyUI, or AUTOMATIC1111 locally or externally.
