# HAAS (Hierarchical Autonomous Agent Swarm)

Create a self-organizing and ethically governed ecosystem of AI agents, inspired by the ACE Framework. HAAS leverages OpenAI's latest agent-based APIs to build fully autonomous swarms.

**Key Features:**
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Multi-tiered agent organization with clear authority levels
- **Supreme Oversight Board (SOB)**: Ethical governance by archetypal wisdom figures
- **Self-Directing**: Pursues missions without human supervision
- **Self-Correcting**: Detects and corrects errors autonomously  
- **Self-Improving**: Enhances capabilities over time
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Secure agent privilege management

**Use Cases:**
- Complex project management and coordination
- Ethical AI system governance
- Autonomous business operation simulation
- Research and development automation
- Large-scale problem solving
- Organizational behavior modeling

**Technical Requirements:**
- Python environment
- OpenAI API access with latest Agents endpoint
- Environment variables configuration
- Discord community access (optional)

**Installation:**
```bash
# Source environment variables
source .env

# Run tool demo
python tool_demo.py
```

**System Architecture:**
- **Supreme Oversight Board (SOB)**: Top-tier ethical governance
  - Captain Picard, Socrates, King Solomon, Gandhi, Marcus Aurelius, Tony Stark
- **Executive Agents**: Operational leadership and domain management  
- **Sub-Agents**: Specialized task-oriented agents

**Core Mission:**
*"Reduce suffering in the universe, increase prosperity in the universe, and increase understanding in the universe"*

**Agent Control Mechanism:**
- **Hierarchical Instantiation**: Agents can only create sub-agents one level below
- **Lineage Termination**: Agents can terminate their descendant agents
- **Privilege Inheritance**: Sub-agents inherit subset of creator's privileges
- **Ethical Oversight**: SOB maintains ultimate authority

**Ethical Framework:**
- Archetypal wisdom representation
- Continuous ethical deliberation
- Value alignment enforcement
- Moral compass for all decisions

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Create tool creator and tool user agents
python tool_demo.py

# Tool creator: Design custom tools based on requirements
# Tool user: Utilize integrated tools for task completion
```

**Advanced Features:**
- **Dynamic Agent Creation**: Runtime agent instantiation based on needs
- **Ethical Decision Making**: Multi-perspective wisdom integration
- **Resource Management**: Intelligent allocation and optimization
- **Mission Alignment**: Continuous adherence to core values
- **Autonomous Evolution**: Self-improving system capabilities
