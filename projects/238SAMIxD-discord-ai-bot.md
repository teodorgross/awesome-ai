# Discord AI Bot

**Discord AI Bot** is an open-source chatbot that seamlessly integrates Ollama's local language models with AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion to provide both conversational AI and image generation capabilities directly within Discord servers. Currently in maintenance mode with a TypeScript rewrite in progress, this project offers a self-hosted solution for communities wanting AI-powered interactions.

## Key Features

**Dual AI Capabilities**
- **Text Generation**: Powered by Ollama with support for multiple local LLM models (Llama2, Orca, Mistral, etc.)
- **Image Generation**: Integration with AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion WebUI for AI-generated artwork
- **Local Processing**: All AI operations run locally, ensuring privacy and control
- **No API Costs**: Completely self-hosted solution without recurring API fees

**Discord Integration**
- **Mention-Based Interaction**: Users interact with the bot by @mentioning it
- **Channel-Specific Operation**: Configurable to work in specific Discord channels
- **Message History**: Reads message history for context-aware conversations
- **User Recognition**: Handles user mentions and replaces them with usernames for better context

**Multi-Server Support**
- **Multiple Ollama Instances**: Can connect to multiple Ollama servers simultaneously
- **Load Distribution**: Separate URLs with commas for distributed processing
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle multiple Discord servers and channels
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easy setup for different deployment scenarios

## Technical Architecture

**Core Components**
- **Node.js Backend**: Built with modern JavaScript (v14+ required)
- **Discord.js Integration**: Full Discord API integration with proper permissions handling
- **Ollama API Client**: Direct communication with local Ollama instances
- **Stable Diffusion API**: REST API integration with AUTOMATIC1111 WebUI
- **Docker Support**: Containerized deployment with Docker Compose

**Configuration Management**
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration through .env files
- **Custom System Messages**: Configurable bot personality and behavior
- **Channel Management**: Specific channel targeting with ID-based configuration
- **Model Selection**: Easy switching between different Ollama models

## Installation & Setup

**Prerequisites**
- Node.js v14+ installed
