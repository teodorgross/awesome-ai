# DragGAN

DragGAN is the official implementation of the groundbreaking SIGGRAPH 2023 paper that introduces interactive point-based manipulation of generative image manifolds. This innovative approach enables users to precisely edit images by simply dragging points on the image to achieve desired modifications.

## Key Features

**Interactive Point-Based Editing**
Revolutionary interface that allows users to edit images by dragging specific points to new locations, providing intuitive and precise control over image manipulation.

**Generative Image Manifold Manipulation**
Leverages advanced GAN technology to manipulate images within the learned generative manifold, ensuring realistic and coherent edits.

**Real-Time Visual Feedback**
Provides immediate visual feedback during the editing process, allowing users to see changes in real-time as they drag control points.

**High-Quality Results**
Produces professional-quality image edits that maintain photorealistic appearance and natural consistency.

## Target Users

**Primary Users**
- Digital artists and graphic designers
- Photo editors and retouchers
- Creative professionals in advertising and media
- Researchers in computer vision and graphics

**Secondary Users**
